# Amazon_Clone
I used only HTML and CSS to create Amazon clone.
Creating a website clone is an ambitious project that involves replicating the user interface and functionality of a well-established platform. In this case, the chosen platform is Amazon, one of the largest and most popular online marketplaces globally. The objective of this project is to understand and implement the key features and design elements that contribute to Amazon’s success in the e-commerce domain. The scope of this project encompasses the development of a static website using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, The use of external libraries, such as Font Awesome for icons, enhances the visual appeal and functionality of the site. The website aims to mimic Amazon’s layout, including a navigation bar, search box, promotional hero section, product cards, and footer. The project utilizes HTML for creating the structure of the web pages, defining the layout, and organizing content. CSS is employed to style the elements, providing a visually cohesive and aesthetically pleasing appearance.  External resources like the Font Awesome library and Google Fonts enhance the overall design and user experience.
